When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I need a remote repository when I need to share what I am doing with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I need to be able to control updates to my remote repository on github by working as much as possible locally to reduce traffic and commit numbers

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Brief descriptions 
Clone - A copy of the repository, this can be on a local machine or on github
Fork - A clone one on the github server with a link to the source of the repository
Branch - A deviation from the main code. This can be a new feature or task.

Usage
Clone - a clone is made if one wants a copy of the remote repository on the local computer.
Fork - a fork is made when one wants a copy of the repository from one github account to another
Branch - a branch is created when one wants to add a new feature on the project or 
collaborating with others on a project the branches can be made for different tasks handled by different people.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

The last copy makes it easier to resolve conflicts should there be any caused by making changes remotely.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Collaborating without using Git or Github will be much harder than collaborating with it. 
Github is especially useful becuase it has added feauters that are just not as apparent when 
using just Git on a local computer. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Changes are best done in branches because they assist in avoiding horrible mistakes that might otherwise be introduced also useful when working in a particular repository as a team.
