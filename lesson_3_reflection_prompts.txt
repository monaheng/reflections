When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I need a remote repository when I need to share what I am doing with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I need to be able to control updates to my remote repository on github by working as much as possible locally
